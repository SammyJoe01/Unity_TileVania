# **TileVania Game**
This repository contains the source code and assets for a 2D platformer game developed using Unity. The game features a player character with various movement abilities, enemies, collectible coins, and level progression.

## **How to Play**
The game is a 2D platformer where the player controls a character through levels filled with obstacles, enemies, and collectible coins. The objective is to navigate each level, defeat enemies, and reach the exit to progress. The player can move horizontally, jump, and climb ladders. Enemies move horizontally and must be avoided or defeated using a shooting ability. Collecting coins increases the player's score. Levels have platforms, obstacles, and traps, requiring careful navigation. As the game progresses, levels become more challenging. Reaching the level exit triggers loading of the next level, allowing the player to continue.
